DIY EV charging using excess PV energy

Trying to create a dynamic algo to ensure I charge my EV with any excess PV and a bit from the PV batteries but to balance such that I will have enough for the evening.

#Prerequists 

* I have roughly enough battery storage to last me 1 night and 1 day.
* I live in the UK which has variable sunshine. Even more complex in autumn, winter and spring. 
* I have cheap overnight (23:30-05:30) tarrif which is 10p/KWh rather than 47p/KWh
* I want to ensure that I put enough power into the batteries to run during peak times
